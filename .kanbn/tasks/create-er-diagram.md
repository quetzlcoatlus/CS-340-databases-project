# Create ER Diagram

An ER diagram that matches your database outline. Note -- ER diagrams are a logical model of databases, and often omit some details. For example, entities maybe modeled without any attributes. M:N relationships can be shown without using any intersection tables. ER diagrams may omit these details for brevity and simplicity. If you choose to make your ER diagram more detailed by adding most attributes and also showing the intersection tables in your ERD, this is not necessarily wrong. But we prefer that you save some of the implementation details for the schema you will create in a later Project Step.

## Sub-tasks

- [x] Use Visio, Draw.io, or MySQL Workbench to create the diagram.
- [x] Ensure notation matches course materials and aligns with the written Database Outline.
