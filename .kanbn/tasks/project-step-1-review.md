# Project Step 1 Review

Review Drafts by your classmates to learn from their successes and mistakes. Look for two different drafts which have received less than 4 reviews so far (6 for a group of 3). Post your review as a reply to the draft. The first four reviews (6 for a group of 3) for every draft are eligible for credit. (Meaning, if a draft already has four reviews (6 for a group of 3) and you post the fifth (7th for a group of 3) review, you won't get credit for that review.)
